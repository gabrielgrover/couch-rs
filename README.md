## Documentation

## Installation

Include this dependency in the Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
couch_rs = "0.10"
```

## Description

This crate is an interface to CouchDB HTTP REST API. Works with stable Rust.

This library is a spin-off based on the excellent work done by Mathieu Amiot and others at Yellow Innovation on the Sofa
library. The original project can be found at <https://github.com/YellowInnovation/sofa>

The Sofa library lacked support for async I/O, and missed a few essential operations we needed in our projects. That's
why I've decided to create a new project based on the original Sofa code.

The rust-rs library has been updated to the Rust 2018 edition standards, uses async I/O, and compiles against the latest
serde and reqwest libraries.

**NOT 1.0 YET, so expect changes**

**Supports CouchDB 2.3.0 and up. Used in production with various CouchDB versions, including 3.3.3**

Be sure to check [CouchDB's Documentation](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/index.html) in detail to see what's
possible.

## Usage

A typical find operation looks like this:

```rust
use couch_rs::types::find::FindQuery;
use std::error::Error;
use serde_json::Value;
use couch_rs::document::DocumentCollection;

const DB_HOST: &str = "http://localhost:5984";
const TEST_DB: &str = "test_db";

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
  let client = couch_rs::Client::new(DB_HOST, "admin", "password")?;
  let db = client.db(TEST_DB).await?;
  let find_all = FindQuery::find_all();
  let docs = db.find_raw(&find_all).await?;
  Ok(())
}
```

## Examples

You can launch the included example with:

```shell script
cargo run --example basic_operations
```

## Running tests

Make sure that you have an instance of CouchDB 2.0+ running, either via the supplied `docker-compose.yml` file or by
yourself. It must be listening on the default port. Since Couch 3.0 the "Admin Party" mode is no longer supported. This
means you need to provide a username and password during launch. The tests and examples assume an "admin" CouchDB user
with a "password" CouchDB password. Docker run command:

```shell script
docker run --rm -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password couchdb:3
```

And then
`cargo test --features=integration-tests -- --test-threads=1`

Single-threading the tests is very important because we need to make sure that the basic features are working before
actually testing features on dbs/documents.

If bash is available on your environment, you can also use the `test.sh` script which basically does the same thing
described above.
