## [0.8.23] - 2020-10-05

    - To use the generic `Value`, either use a `.._raw` function, or type the query with `::<Value>`
    - Value now holds the raw CouchDocument, including `_id` and `_rev` fields.
    - See the examples and the tests for more details

    - `Value` implements `TypedCouchDocument` traits
